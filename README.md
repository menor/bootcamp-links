Dev Bootcamp Links
==================

A list of links to things I'm reading to prepare for Dev Bootcamp in SF. 

## Git ##
Git is a distributed version control and source code management system with an emphasis on speed. Basically is what a lot of people use to collaborate on writing code together.

[Git - The Simple Guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) by Roger Dudler. Great guide to start using Git in 5 minutes. Includes links to more guides and resources


## Markdown ##
Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

[Markdown Quick Reference](http://www.darkcoding.net/software/markdown-quick-reference/) by Graham King.

[Mou](http://mouapp.com/) Mou is a donation based Markdown editor for OSX really simple and well done.
